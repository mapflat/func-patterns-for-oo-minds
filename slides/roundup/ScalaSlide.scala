    * Adopting functional libraries is an emotional ride
      - Sometimes feeling stupid
      - Rewarding feeling of mastery
        - Leaving team members behind?
      - Mix of wow! and yuck!

    * New tools for your box, not found elsewhere
      - Sometimes great match
      - Trim away boilerplate for matching use cases

    * Functional monastery visit is not required
      - Get far with simple constructs without magic

    * Be careful out there!
      - Resist being cryptic and mystic.
      - Many libraries set a bad example.
      - Document any weirdness that you decide to take up e.g. \/
      - Move coding culture slowly, as a team.
