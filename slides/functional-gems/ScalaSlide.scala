    * I'd like to share things I have learnt while getting exposed to functional constructs

    * This talks contains
      - Functional constructs that I consider useful in non-functional contexts
        - Typed error handling
        - Data processing with optics
      - Positive and negative experiences adopting functional libraries

    * This talk is not
      - Trying to convince you to go all functional
      - Held by a functional programming expert / zealot
      - Held by a writer of / expert on the libraries presented
        - Sometimes I failed to apply libraries

    * Code examples in Scala + Java
      - Scala reading skills are useful
