# Monocle

* Read/write lenses on case classes
  - Less concise than e.g. Play JSON
  - Easier to customise and build on
* Macros for lens generation

Issues:

* Couldn't get @Lenses case class decorator to work
* Argonaut + Monocle has really good looking JSON lens integration
  - Failed to get it to work
