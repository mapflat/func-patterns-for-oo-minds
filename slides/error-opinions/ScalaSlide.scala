    Error handling with dual types conclusions and opinions

    * In harmony with type system
      - Control over domain error handling, e.g. defining system vs domain errors

    * There is a learn & mindset threshold for functional style libraries
      - Ascii art culture makes this worse. Examples from scalaz: <<?: <++> |+| =?>= :++>> -+- ?|?
      - Risk of developer cultural divide
      - Scalactic & Cats might be smoother

    * scala.util.* takes you far
